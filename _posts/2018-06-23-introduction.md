<div class="introduction">
  <h2> Hello World! ... I mean, Hello there! </h2>
  <p>
    If you've already visited the about page, then you'll 
    know exactly who I am. Or actually, you'll just have an 
    idea of who I am. And if you haven't, then allow me to 
    introduce myself. My name is Samiur Rahman, but 
    you can just call me Sam. Now, before I go any further, 
    give me a moment to escape this body of HTML.
  </p>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

Ah, much better! Now, where were we? Or perhaps a better question that you should consider asking yourself is, `where am I?`
This is just my personal blog, where I'll keep readers up to date by making an attempt to document everything that goes on 
in my life.

I'll frequently discuss topics related to the tags of this post, which revolve around my personal, school, and work life.
For example, in my personal-tagged posts, you'll find content related to my hobbies and side-projects; in my school-tagged 
posts, you'll find content related to the life of a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo; and in my work-tagged posts, you'll find content related to my experiences of being on co-op.

And that's the end of my introduction! I'm hoping to get some new content up very soon (if my schedule allows for it ðŸ˜­).
Thanks for reading!
