  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Samiur Rahman. You've probably never seen the name "Samiur" before. 
    It's pronounced as "Sameer", but to make things easier, you can just call me Sam. 
    I'm a second-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, 
    located in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. I am an experienced software developer, 
    with a demonstrated history of working in the Fintech indsutry, in both Full-stack 
    Web development, as well as iOS Mobile development. I am currently looking for 
    a co-op placement for the Fall 2018 term. If you have any inquiries, you can contact 
    me by clicking on any of the links found at the top of this page.
